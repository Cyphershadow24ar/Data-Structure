# About
The purpose of this repository is to provide clear and concise C implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. 
Each implementation is accompanied by a description and, where applicable, a demonstration of how it can be used.

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
-> Basic understanding of C programming
-> A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

# -> Installation
   Clone the repository:
   bash : git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git cd your-repo-name
